Chapter 1: The Test
*******************

This is a test chapter.

This is a paragraph with some *emphasized words*.
It also has some **strong emphasis**, which is a little more exciting.

.. In this paragraph, we thought, :thought:`Wouldn't it be nice to 
   have some sort of 'thought' markup?` Indeed it would, friend. 
   Indeed it would. Even better? :textsc:`Small caps text!`

  "My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."

  "Stop saying that!"

Here is another paragraph. And now for some verse:

| OH POINTY BIRDS
| OH POINTY POINTY
| ANOINT MY HEAD
| ANOINTY NOINTY
