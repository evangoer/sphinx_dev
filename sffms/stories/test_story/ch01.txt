Chapter 1: The Test
*******************

This is a test chapter.

This is a paragraph with some *emphasized words*.
It also has some **strong emphasis**, which is a little more exciting.

In this paragraph, we thought, :thought:`Wouldn't it be nice to 
have some sort of 'thought' markup?` Indeed it would, friend. 
Indeed it would. Even better? :textsc:`Small caps text!`

  "My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."

  "Stop saying that!"

.. synopsis:: 

   We've decided to put a synopsis here in the middle of the story
   because having a synopsis here is *rad*.

   First, our hero has a problem with some mobsters.

   Then he blows up all the mobsters. BOOM! KABLOOIE! 

This is more text in the first chapter, yes indeedy!

Scene XII
=========

.. suppress_numbering::

There is a suppress_numbering directive in this scene. It should NOT 
actually have any effect on the parent chapter because it is in the
child scene. suppress_numbering is designed to be a direct child of
the chapter it's supposed to act upon. If it goes any deeper -- poof!

Here is another paragraph. And now for some verse:

| OH POINTY BIRDS
| OH POINTY POINTY
|
| ANOINT MY HEAD
| ANOINTY NOINTY
