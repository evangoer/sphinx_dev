Your Title
##########

This is an example story. Above, you can see a story title,
"Your Title". The actual words in the title above will not 
actually appear in the PDF -- instead, the PDF will display
the sffms_title you defined in conf.py. 

However, the title "Your Title" is still important. First,
it's required to generate the proper structure for your 
story. Second, it *will* appear if you decide to generate 
HTML. It's therefore a good idea to change the title above 
to be the same as the sffms_title. Be sure to change the 
overline and underline to match your new title.

Scene Break 1
=============

This is a scene break. 

If you generate PDF, this text will show up simply as a "#", a
scene break in Standard Manuscript format. It doesn't actually 
matter that the text says "Scene Break 1".

If you generate HTML, you will actually see a new section with 
a visible title of "Scene Break 1". That will look a little silly.
The good news is that you can change the text to anything you like,
as long as you keep the underline of "=" characters the same length. 
One option is to give the scene break a sensible descriptive title.
Another option is to just replace "Scene Break" with a roman numeral 
or a "#" character.  

Scene Break
===========

Here is more text after yet another scene break. Keep in mind that
you don't have to have any scene breaks at all. You can just have 
a story title at the top followed by lots of paragraphs, and 
everything will work fine.
