This is a new chapter. Like the short story example, it has scenes.

Scene Break 1
=============

If you generate PDF, this text will show up simply as a "#", a
scene break in Standard Manuscript format. It doesn't actually 
matter that the text says "Scene Break 1".

If you generate HTML, you will actually see a new section with 
a visible title of "Scene Break 1". That will look a little silly.
The good news is that you can change the text to anything you like,
as long as you keep the underline of "=" characters the same length. 
One option is to give the scene break a sensible descriptive title.
Another option is to just replace "Scene Break" with a roman numeral 
or a "#" character.  

Scene Break
===========

Here is more text after yet another scene break. Keep in mind that
you don't have to have any scene breaks at all. You can just have 
chapters with paragraphs, and everything will work fine.
