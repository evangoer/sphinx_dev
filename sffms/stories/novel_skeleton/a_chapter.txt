A Chapter of Some Sort
**********************

This is an example chapter. Above is the title of the 
chapter, "A Chapter of Some Sort". 

Why does this chapter appear first? The file "index.txt" 
defines the structure of your novel. Under the "toctree" 
directive, you can add files in any order.

The layout of a novel is a little bit different from a 
short story. For novels, sffms makes sure that each 
chapter starts on a new page. It also starts the chapter
title closer to the middle of the page.
