   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to sffms's documentation!
=================================

sffms is a `Sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ extension for outputting 
`sffms-style LaTeX <http://www.mcdemarco.net/sffms/>`_.  If you author 
short stories or novels using Sphinx, you can use this extension to 
create PDFs that adhere to
`Standard Manuscript Format <http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mslee/format.html>`_.

This Python package has only been tested and verified to work:

* on Mac OS X 10.6
* with Python 2.6
* with Sphinx 1.0.5
* using an old TeTeX distribution with the sffms LaTeX class manually installed

This package should work with a wider variety of environments -- in theory. 
If you have sffms installed and working with some other combination of software, 
please `let the author know <http://www.goer.org/About/#contact>`_.
